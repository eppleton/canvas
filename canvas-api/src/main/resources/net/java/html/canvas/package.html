        Universal, flexible, capable, effective, highly efficient Canvas API for any device on the planet (and beyond). 
        The purpose of this API is to create a common interface for drawing to a canvas using Java. Currently there are implementations for JavaFX Canvas and for
        HTML 5 Canvas. You can choose your implementation depending on the availability on your target platform and performance
        requirements.

         For HTML5:
        <pre>
<code>
GraphicsContext2D gc = HTML5Graphics.getOrCreate("canvas");
</code>
        </pre>
        For JavaFX:
        <pre>
<code>
GraphicsContext2D gc = JavaFXGraphics.getOrCreate("canvas");
</code></pre>
