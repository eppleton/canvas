        Universal, flexible, capable, effective, highly efficient Canvas API for any device on the planet (and beyond). 
        The purpose of this API is to create a common interface for drawing to a canvas using Java. Currently there are implementations for JavaFX Canvas and for
        HTML 5 Canvas. You can choose your implementation depending on the availability on your target platform and performance
        requirements.

        The entry point is the GraphicsUtils class. It gives you access to the GraphicsContext that you can use to draw.
        Currently you need to pass in a GraphicsEnvironment:
        // JavaFX implementation available here https://github.com/eppleton/FXGameEngine
        For HTML5:
        <pre>
<code>
GraphicsContext2D gc = HTML5Graphics.create("canvas");
</code>
        </pre>
        For JavaFX:
        <pre>
<code>
GraphicsContext gc = JavaFXGraphics.create("canvas");
</code></pre>
