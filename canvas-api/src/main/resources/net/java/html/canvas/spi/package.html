        SPI for enabling the Canvas API on different platforms. Currently there are 
        implementations for HTML5 Canvas and JavaFX Canvas. If you want to create another 
        implementation, e.g. because you expect performance gains, or HTML5 and JavaFX
        are not available on your platform, you need to implement one interface, GraphicsEnvironment.
